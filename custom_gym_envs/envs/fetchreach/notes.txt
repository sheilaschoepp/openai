What is a state/observation in FetchReach-v1?

sources:
https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/1503

In fetch_env.py _get_obs() method:

grip_pos is the position of the gripper, with the first 3 elements being the (x,y,z) position and the final four elements
being the gripper's orientation (quaternion x,y,z,w)

gripper_state is a measure of the gripper's opening

grip_velp is the (x,y,z) velocity of the gripper

gripper_vel is the velocity of the gripper's opening/closing

In fetchreach_observation_wrapper.py:

we concatenate the observation and desired (x,y,z) goal position to get a 13 dimensional array
