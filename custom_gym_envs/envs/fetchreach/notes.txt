What is a state/observation in FetchReach-v1?

sources:
https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/1503

In fetch_env.py _get_obs() method:

grip_pos is the (x,y,z) position of the gripper

gripper_state includes two measures of the gripper's opening

grip_velp is the (x,y,z) velocity of the gripper

gripper_vel includes two measures of the velocity of the gripper's opening/closing

In fetchreach_observation_wrapper.py:

we concatenate the observation and desired (x,y,z) goal position to get a 13 dimensional array
